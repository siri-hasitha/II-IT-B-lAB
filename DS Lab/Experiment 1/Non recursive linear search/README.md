# Aim: Write a program that uses non-recursive function to perform linear search.

## Linear search: Linear search in C to find whether a number is present in an array. If it's present, then at what location it occurs. It is also known as a sequential search. It is straightforward and works as follows: we compare each element with the element to search until we find it or the list ends.

### STEP BY STEP PROCEDURE:

### key element = 15
1. Read the number of array elements and the elements of the array.(here array = 11,7,9,16,24,4,15,98,54,60 n = 10)
2. The key element to be searched to be entered.(here it is 15)
3. The complier searches for number 15 from the given array, beginning with the first element.
4. It matches the key element(15) with the elements present in the array.
5. If the key i.e 15  and element in the array are equal, the output is obtained as 'The key element is found at the index’
6. And if the key element is not matched with any element of the array, it returns as 'The key element is not found'
7. In this case, it prints '15 is found at the index 6' as the element is present in the given array.

### key element = 99
1. Read the number of array elements and the elements of the array.(here array = 11,7,9,16,24,4,15,98,54,60 n = 10)
2. The key element to be searched to be entered.(here it is 99)
3. The complier searches for number 99 from the given array, beginning with the first element.
4. It matches the key element(99) with the elements present in the array.
5. If the key i.e 99  and element in the array are equal, the output is obtained as 'The key element is found at the index’
6. And if the key element is not matched with any element of the array, it returns as 'The key element is not found'
7. In this case, it prints 'The key element is not found' as the element is  not present in the given array.
